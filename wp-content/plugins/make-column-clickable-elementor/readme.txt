Make entire columns, sections and containers clickable in Elementor — improve navigation and user experience with just one link.

== Description ==

*Disclaimer: This plugin has no affiliation or support from Elementor Ltd., quite the opposite.*

Easily make entire columns, sections and containers clickable in Elementor, not just individual elements.

Add a link to any column, section or container, and your visitors will be able to click anywhere inside it — perfect for banners, call-to-action areas, and interactive layouts.

= How to use it =

After installing the plugin, open the Elementor editor, select a Column, Section or Container, and under the Layout settings you’ll find a field to add your custom link.

Works seamlessly with internal and external links, Lightbox, and Elementor PRO popup triggers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

The plugin adds a custom URL field to every column, section and container in the Elementor editor. Once you add a link, the entire area becomes clickable.

It works using JavaScript, so it doesn’t create a real <a> tag. For best SEO and accessibility, we recommend also adding regular links to inner elements — ensuring both columns and default elements work perfectly.
